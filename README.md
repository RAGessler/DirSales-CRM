# PersonalCRM - DEMO
Capstone Project for Dev Code Camp. I have chosen to freeze this project after the initial sprint so you can see the origional submission.  Inspired by some friends of mine who own small businesses and wanted to manage their network better without using a large or bulky CRM.

This project is currently hosted on AWS and you can view it here: http://crmfrontend.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com

This project will not be reciving any new features for demo purposes but I will be making to my other repo labled PersonalCRM, feel free to take a look.
